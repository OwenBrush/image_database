# Goals:

- This is a simple search interface for a repository of image
- Developed with Test Driven Development principals
- Created for the Shopify data engineering internship challenge

# How it works:
 
- The app is a terminal that prints results and can be given search filters via text commands
- The file manager loads a list of all valid image files in the image directory and makes them available in the form of a pandas DataFrame
- The search engine applies the user input search filters to the dataframe so that the filtered results are shown

# Try it out:

[Run it from a virtual IDE here](https://replit.com/@OwenBrush/imagedatabase#.replit)  

- Click the green 'run' button to start it
- To see search results you may need to scroll the console up after entering a command
